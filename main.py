# pygame is a library which has modules (e.g. display or event). If you want to call a function specific to the module, we first
# call the library, then the module in question, and at last the function, for example pygame.display.flip(). screen is an object created
# by me, so it's functions are called like methods from a class, instead of using logic from above. 
# Regarding flip(): firstly, a buffer is a region in memory where pixel data is stored. pygame uses two buffers: back and front. Back buffer is
# hidden from a player, game screen is updated there with each line of code. Then, at the end of the game loop, we use flip() to flip that back
# buffer onto the front buffer where player can see changees. It is a useful mechanism, because we show the player the scene, once it's ready.
